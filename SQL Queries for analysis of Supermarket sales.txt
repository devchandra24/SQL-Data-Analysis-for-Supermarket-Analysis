SELECT *
FROM superstore
LIMIT 5;

1. What are total sales and total profits of each year?

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('year', orderdate) AS year, 
SUM(sales) AS total_sales,
SUM(profit) AS total_profit
FROM superstore
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year ASC;

2. What are the total profits and total sales per quarter?

SELECT 
  date_part('year', orderdate) AS year, 
  CASE 
    WHEN date_part('month', orderdate) IN (1,2,3) THEN 'Q1'
    WHEN date_part('month', orderdate) IN (4,5,6) THEN 'Q2'
    WHEN date_part('month', orderdate) IN (7,8,9) THEN 'Q3'
    ELSE 'Q4'
  END AS quarter,
  SUM(sales) AS total_sales,
  SUM(profit) AS total_profit
FROM superstore
GROUP BY year, quarter
ORDER BY year, quarter;

3. What region generates the highest sales and profits ?

SELECT region, SUM(sales) AS total_sales, SUM(profit) AS total_profits
FROM superstore
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY total_profits DESC;

4. What state and city brings in the highest sales and profits ?

SELECT State, SUM(Sales) as Total_Sales, SUM(Profit) as Total_Profits, ROUND((SUM(profit) / SUM(sales)) * 100, 2) as profit_margin
FROM superstore
GROUP BY State
ORDER BY Total_Profits DESC
LIMIT 10;

SELECT City, SUM(Sales) as Total_Sales, SUM(Profit) as Total_Profits, ROUND((SUM(profit) / SUM(sales)) * 100, 2) as profit_margin
FROM superstore
GROUP BY City
ORDER BY Total_Profits DESC
LIMIT 10;

5. The relationship between discount and sales and the total discount per category

SELECT Discount, AVG(Sales) AS Avg_Sales
FROM superstore
GROUP BY Discount
ORDER BY Discount;

Let’s observe the total discount per product category:
SELECT category, SUM(discount) AS total_discount
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_discount DESC;

6. What category generates the highest sales and profits in each region and state ?

First, let’s observe the total sales and total profits of each category with their profit margins:
SELECT category, SUM(sales) AS total_sales, SUM(profit) AS total_profit, ROUND(SUM(profit)/SUM(sales)*100, 2) AS profit_margin
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_profit DESC;

Let’s observe the highest total sales and total profits per Category in each region:
SELECT region, category, SUM(sales) AS total_sales, SUM(profit) AS total_profit
FROM superstore
GROUP BY region, category
ORDER BY total_profit DESC;

Now let’s see the highest total sales and total profits per Category in each state:
SELECT state, category, SUM(sales) AS total_sales, SUM(profit) AS total_profit
FROM superstore
GROUP BY state, category
ORDER BY total_profit DESC;

7. What subcategory generates the highest sales and profits in each region and state ?

Let’s observe the total sales and total profits of each subcategory with their profit margins:
SELECT subcategory, SUM(sales) AS total_sales, SUM(profit) AS total_profit, ROUND(SUM(profit)/SUM(sales)*100, 2) AS profit_margin
FROM superstore
GROUP BY subcategory
ORDER BY total_profit DESC;

Now let’s see the highest total sales and total profits per subcategory in each region:
SELECT region, subcategory, SUM(sales) AS total_sales, SUM(profit) AS total_profit
FROM superstore
GROUP BY region, subcategory
ORDER BY total_profit DESC;

Now let’s see the least performing ones:
SELECT region, subcategory, SUM(sales) AS total_sales, SUM(profit) AS total_profit
FROM superstore
GROUP BY region, subcategory
ORDER BY total_profit ASC;

Now let’s see the highest total sales and total profits per subcategory in each state:
SELECT state, subcategory, SUM(sales) AS total_sales, SUM(profit) AS total_profit
FROM superstore
GROUP BY state, subcategory
ORDER BY total_profit DESC;

Let’s see the lowest sales and profits. Still in order for biggest lost in profits.

SELECT state, subcategory, SUM(sales) AS total_sales, SUM(profit) AS total_profit
FROM superstore
GROUP BY state, subcategory
ORDER BY total_profit ASC;

8. What are the names of the products that are the most and least profitable to us?

Let’s verify this information:
SELECT productname, SUM(sales) AS total_sales, SUM(profit) AS total_profit
FROM superstore
GROUP BY productname
ORDER BY total_profit DESC;

Let’s verify our less proftable ones:
SELECT productname, SUM(sales) AS total_sales, SUM(profit) AS total_profit
FROM superstore
GROUP BY productname
ORDER BY total_profit ASC;

9. What segment makes the most of our profits and sales ?

This can be verified with the help of the following query:
SELECT segment, SUM(sales) AS total_sales, SUM(profit) AS total_profit
FROM superstore
GROUP BY segment
ORDER BY total_profit DESC;

10. How many customers do we have (unique customer IDs) in total and how much per region and state?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customerid) AS total_customers
FROM superstore;

Regionally, we had the following:
SELECT region, COUNT(DISTINCT customerid) AS total_customers
FROM superstore
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY total_customers DESC;

The areas where we have the least that passed by there are:
SELECT state, COUNT(DISTINCT customerid) AS total_customers
FROM superstore
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY total_customers ASC;

11. Customer rewards program

SELECT customerid, 
SUM(sales) AS total_sales,
SUM(profit) AS total_profit
FROM superstore
GROUP BY customerid
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 15;

12. Average shipping time per class and in total

SELECT ROUND(AVG(shipdate - orderdate),1) AS avg_shipping_time
FROM superstore

The shipping time in each shipping mode is:
SELECT shipmode,ROUND(AVG(shipdate - orderdate),1) AS avg_shipping_time
FROM superstore
GROUP BY shipmode
ORDER BY avg_shipping_time
